                Sample blog post
                January 1, 2021 by Mark

                This blog post shows a few different types of content that’s supported and styled with Bootstrap. Basic
                typography, lists, tables, images, code, and more are all supported as expected.

                This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It has been written to fill the available space
                and show how a longer snippet of text affects the surrounding content. We'll repeat it often to keep the
                demonstration flowing, so be on the lookout for this exact same string of text.

                Blockquotes
                This is an example blockquote in action:

                Quoted text goes here.

                Example lists
                This is some additional paragraph placeholder content. It's a slightly shorter version of the other
                highly repetitive body text used throughout. This is an example unordered list:

                First list item
                Second list item with a longer description
                Third list item to close it out
                And this is an ordered list:

                First list item
                Second list item with a longer description
                Third list item to close it out
                And this is a definition list:

                HyperText Markup Language (HTML)
                The language used to describe and define the content of a Web page
                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

                JavaScript (JS)

                Inline HTML elements
                HTML defines a long list of available inline tags, a complete list of which can be found on the Mozilla
                Developer Network.
